# AirplaneDefense
This is an original game created using python's module, pygame.

## Game Rules:
This is a tower defense inspired game:

The goal of the game is to survive as many waves of airplanes as possible, with each wave having increasing speed, and reach the highest score possible.

## How to play this game:
Just download the zip, unzip all the files, and run main.py!

### Controls:
W, S, Q, and mouse control

Pressing down W moves your player up and S moves it down. Use your mouse to move the cursor and left click to shoot down the airplanes trying to reach the left side (your "tower"). Press Q anytime during the game to pause the game. Left click anywhere or press Q again to unpause. Clicking the 'x' button on the window during a game will exit the game and save your score. Clicking it in the main menu will close the game.

If the planes hit your tank they will also die.

If the planes reach your "tower", they will blow up and you will lose a life.

You have a total of 20 lives.

## Scoring:
10 points will be awarded for every hit with the missile;  
5 points if you kill them with your tank;  
No points will be rewarded if they blow up when hitting the "tower".

A copy of these instructions can be found in main.py, and an illustration of instructions can be found inside the game, by clicking instructions.

## Warnings!
##### Do **NOT** delete OR modify highscores.txt. The game will not break, but the list of high scores will either not show up in the main menu until a full game has been played, or it will display weirdly.
##### Do **NOT** (please) delete gameSprites.py, or any of the files inside images, fonts, AND sounds. They are necessary files and the game will **NOT** run if they are missing.

## Extras:
I have added a "hacks" button. Do not worry, this will not hack your device. It is a small feature to let the computer play for you, essentially a playthrough. Since the game completely depends on RNG (god bless it), the computer's results may vary. For me, the highest it has gotten is wave 25 with 3535 score.

I have attached a License.txt for the sprite sheet, and provided images, thank you, Kenney Vleugels.
